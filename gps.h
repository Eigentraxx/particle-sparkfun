  Reading lat and long via UBX binary commands - no more NMEA parsing!

  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to query a Ublox module for its lat/long/altitude. We also
  turn off the NMEA output on the I2C port. This decreases the amount of I2C traffic
  dramatically.

  Note: Long/lat are large numbers because they are * 10^7. To convert lat/long
  to something google maps understands simply divide the numbers by 10,000,000. We
  do this so that we don't have to use floating point numbers.

  Leave NMEA parsing behind. Now you can simply ask the module for the datums you want!

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GPS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
